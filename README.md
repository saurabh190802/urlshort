# PARENTS-TEACHERS-INTERACTION-WEBAPP-ZOHO-CATALYST
Schools and parent communication have reached a crossroad in recent years, so we have decided to build a web application which can help and improve the communication between parents and teachers. Where Teachers can post the information regarding the ward, so that parents can see that. Parent -Teacher communication apps emerged as the remediable factor to this myriad of problems, helping teachers communicate with parents effectively and seamlessly. Adopting a parent-friendly app that creates engagement and transparency is a must for all educators.
